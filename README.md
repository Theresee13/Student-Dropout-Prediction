# Student-Dropout-Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes student dropout patterns using machine learning models. The dataset used is `student_dropout.csv`, and multiple classification algorithms are implemented, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The goal is to predict student dropout likelihood based on given features.

## Dataset
The dataset (`student_dropout.csv`) is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for preprocessing and analysis. Ensure the dataset is available in the working directory before running the notebook.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and explore its structure.
2. Perform data preprocessing if necessary (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
3. Train multiple classification models and evaluate their performance.
4. Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare results.
5. Visualize model performance using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## Results
The notebook includes a comparative analysis of different models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in predicting student dropouts. The final model selection depends on evaluation metrics and real-world considerations.

## Future Improvements
- Experimenting with additional models (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks)
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Feature engineering to improve model accuracy
